    By specifying the "factory-class-name" for creating java-bean
    and the values for the bean-properties using "properties" of the
    custom-resource, applications can lookup java-bean via JNDI.

    In the sample configuration below, 
    JavaBean org.glassfish.resource.custom.test.Customer
    has attributes (along with getters and setters)

    To initialize the JavaBean with values, set the property name and the value.
    Applications can do  :

    (CustomResourceJavaBean)initialContext.lookup("custom/my-java-bean")

    to get the bean instance that is populated with customerId, customerLocation, customerSince attributes

    Following command will create a resource using this template :

    GLASSFISH_INSTALL_DIR/bin/asadmin add-resources <ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE>


    <resources>
        <custom-resource res-type="org.glassfish.resource.custom.test.Customer" jndi-name="custom/my-java-bean" 
         factory-class="org.glassfish.resources.custom.factory.JavaBeanFactory">
          <property name="customerId" value="cu-101" />
          <property name="customerLocation" value="San Francisco" />
          <property name="customerSince" value="1990" />
        </custom-resource>
    </resources>
